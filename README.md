# testharness

This is a Test harness for core that can then be reused for the many apps.

Many of these aspects are not in the main client but some are in there,
but are mixed up and "spread" into the code base making the code highly coupled,
and hecne preventing us to build more applications.


This has core things that all our apps need such as:

- i18n internationalisation

- Printing

- Responsive Master Details Layout

- Deep Linking and routing

- Help 

It also has tooling around many of these cross cutting things.
